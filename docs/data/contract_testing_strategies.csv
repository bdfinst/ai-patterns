Control Level,Approach,How It Works,Tools,Complexity,Detection Point,Detection Type,Detection Method,AI Improvement,Strengths,Limitations
Full Control,Consumer-Driven Contracts (CDC),Consumer defines contract (subset of provider API it uses). Provider verifies it satisfies all consumer contracts. Shared broker tracks compatibility.,Pact; Spring Cloud Contract; Pactflow,Low–Med,CI,AI-Enhanced,Contract verification; broker management; compat matrix,Generate initial contracts by analyzing consumer code for actual provider endpoint/field usage,Tests only what consumer needs; enables independent deploy; contracts are living coupling documentation,Requires discipline to maintain; initial broker setup cost; versioning complex with many consumers
Full Control,Bi-Directional Contracts,Both sides independently generate API descriptions (consumer from mocks; provider from running API). Broker compares for compatibility.,Pactflow; Specmatic,Low,CI,AI-Enhanced,Schema comparison and compatibility checking,Explain semantic differences beyond schema shape — 'same name; different meaning',Low adoption friction; teams keep existing mocking tools; fast to start,Less precise than CDC; can miss semantic mismatches; requires both sides to keep specs accurate
Full Control,Shared Schema/IDL Validation,Single source of truth schema (protobuf; Avro; GraphQL SDL). Both sides compile against it. CI enforces backward compatibility.,protobuf + buf; Avro + Schema Registry; GraphQL registry,Low,Pre-Commit,Automated,buf; Avro compat modes; protobuf checks — formal verification,Not needed,Strongest shape guarantees; breaking changes caught at compile time; single source of truth,Only validates shape; not behavior; requires all teams on same IDL; doesn't catch logic bugs
Some Influence,Provider-Published Specs,Provider publishes API contract (OpenAPI; AsyncAPI). Consumer validates usage against published spec.,OpenAPI registry; Specmatic; Prism; Schemathesis,Low–Med,CI,AI-Enhanced,Spec linting; schema validation; consumer test execution,Review provider specs against your actual usage to identify which changes matter to you,Works without provider running your tests; fast feedback against real spec,Provider may change spec without warning; trusting spec accuracy; one-directional
Some Influence,API Snapshot / Record-Replay,Record real API interactions from staging. Store as snapshots. Replay in CI to detect changes. Alert on divergence from baseline.,Hoverfly; VCR; Polly.JS; WireMock; Karate,Medium,CI,AI-Enhanced,Recording; replay; comparison — deterministic mechanics,Flag semantic changes (same shape; different meaning) that schema comparison misses; identify stale snapshots,Captures actual behavior; not just docs; works without provider cooperation,Snapshots go stale; staging may not match prod; brittle with dynamic content
Some Influence,Negotiated SLAs + Integration Tests,Negotiate lightweight SLA (response time; error rates; uptime). Run integration tests in shared environment validating SLA.,Shared integration env; PagerDuty/OpsGenie,Medium,Staging,AI-Enhanced,SLA monitoring; synthetic transactions; breach alerting,Draft SLA proposals by analyzing actual service behavior and usage patterns; review SLAs for ambiguity,Formalizes relationship; SLA breaches create shared accountability; catches performance issues,Integration tests are slower/flakier; shared environments are fragile; only detects after deployment
No Control,Consumer-Side Expectations,Write tests defining exact subset of third-party API you depend on. Run against mocks in CI. Periodically verify against real API.,Pact consumer-only; Specmatic; JSON Schema validation,Medium,CI,AI-Enhanced,Running tests against mocks and scheduling real-API checks,Generate expectations by analyzing codebase for every third-party API call and response dependency,You own the definition; catches drift pre-production; mocks keep CI fast,Your expectations may be wrong; lag before detecting changes; real-API runs can be rate-limited
No Control,API Canary / Synthetic Monitoring,Continuously run synthetic transactions against live third-party API. Monitor response shape; latency; error rates. Alert on deviation.,Checkly; Datadog Synthetics; Grafana; CloudWatch Synthetics,Low–Med,Production,Automated,Synthetic monitoring — purpose-built tools for reliability and consistency,Not needed,Near-real-time detection; low setup for critical paths; monitors availability + correctness,Only tests defined paths; rate limits; doesn't catch changes pre-deploy; smoke-test depth
No Control,Anti-Corruption Layer + Boundary Tests,Wrap third-party API in adapter translating their model to your domain. Test adapter extensively. External changes only require adapter updates.,Adapter pattern; Testcontainers; WireMock,Med–High,CI,AI-Enhanced,Adapter unit tests; simulated API tests; CI execution,Help design adapter by analyzing third-party API surface and your domain model for translation mapping,Insulates codebase; change surface is one adapter; enables provider substitution; clean domain model,Higher upfront cost; adapter can have bugs; still need canary for external change detection
No Control,Vendor Changelog Monitoring,Monitor vendor changelog; status page; dev communications. Auto-trigger regression suite on detected changes.,RSS/webhook monitoring; GitHub Actions; regression suite,Med–High,Post-Release,AI-Enhanced,Triggering regression suites from webhooks — automation/CI,Parse vendor changelogs and release notes to assess impact on your integration — strong NLU use case,Proactive; combines vendor comms with verification; builds knowledge of vendor patterns,Vendors don't always announce changes; changelog parsing brittle; high maintenance
