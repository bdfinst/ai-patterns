## Guides

- **[Automated Code Review with AI Agents Reference Architecture](agentic-code-review.md)** - A hybrid approach combining deterministic rules-based tooling with context-aware AI agents to automate everything that can be automated about code review.

- **[Leading an Agentic Development Team](ai-development-playbook.md)** - A playbook for leading AI agents as team members, covering mission setting, acceptance-test-driven development, building focused specialist agents, and validating outcomes over activity.

- **[CD Defect Detection and Remediation Cheat Sheet](defect-detection-and-fixes.md)** - A comprehensive catalog of where defects are created in the value stream, methods for automated detection, and systemic remediation strategies.

- **[Contract Testing Strategies](contract-testing-strategies.md)** - A comprehensive guide to different contract testing approaches based on your level of organizational control over the services you integrate with.

## Articles
