Formatting, linting, static analysis, security scanning;these have deterministic right answers and shouldn't consume human attention. If your team is still catching formatting issues in review, fix your tooling.</p> <p>Similarly, business logic correctness should be validated by tests, not by reading code. If a reviewer has to trace through implementation to determine whether it handles edge cases correctly, that's a missing test, not a review task.</p> <p>This becomes automatable when business rules are documented as test scenarios before coding begins. Agents can then verify that tests exist for each documented scenario and that the tests actually assert the expected outcomes. Review shifts from implementation to requirements. Errors that slip through are requirement errors;scenarios that were never documented;not implementation bugs that a test review would have caught.</p> <p>Even with proper tooling and test coverage, significant review time remains. Reviewers still evaluate naming coherence, domain alignment, architectural fit, documentation accuracy, and test quality;things that require understanding context and intent, not just pattern matching.</p> <p>This was manageable when code generation was the bottleneck. A developer might produce a few hundred lines of reviewable code per day. Review capacity roughly matched generation capacity.</p> <p>AI-assisted code generation has broken this balance. Developers using AI tools can generate code faster than teams can review it. Pull requests queue up. Reviewers batch work to stay efficient, which increases cycle time. The feedback loop that makes code review valuable, the fast iteration on design and approach, degrades.</p> <p>The result is a choice between thoroughness and speed. Teams either maintain review quality and accept slower delivery, or they reduce review depth to keep up. Neither option is good.</p> <p>The solution is to automate everything about code review that can be automated, reserving human attention for decisions that genuinely require human judgment.</p>"},{"location":"agentic-code-review/#goal-automate-everything-automatable","title":"Goal: Automate Everything Automatable","text":"<p>The goal is to reduce human review to only those decisions that genuinely require human judgment; design tradeoffs, architectural direction, business logic validation. However, if you are doing any of these in code review, you need to stop here and fix reasons these are not resolved before coding. Everything else should be caught and, where possible, corrected automatically.</p> <p>This process can run at any point: on commit, on push, on pull request creation, on demand, or continuously in the background. The trigger doesn't matter. What matters is that by the time a human reviewer sees the code, the automatable concerns have already been handled. Be aware that I am accountable to my AI spend rate and act accordingly when I do this and will run this when I integrate to the trunk.</p>"},{"location":"agentic-code-review/#a-two-phase-review-architecture","title":"A Two-Phase Review Architecture","text":"<p>This process separates concerns into what machines do well deterministically (Phase 1) and what requires contextual reasoning (Phase 2), with a feedback loop that allows automated correction before human review.</p> flowchart TD     subgraph Review[\"Automated Review Process\"]         A[Review Triggered] --&gt; B{Phase 1: Deterministic Checks}          subgraph Phase1[\"Phase 1: Rules-Based Tools\"]             B --&gt; C[Formatting &amp; Linting]             B --&gt; D[Static Analysis]             B --&gt; E[Security Scanning]             B --&gt; F[Test Execution]         end          C --&gt; G{All Passed?}         D --&gt; G         E --&gt; G         F --&gt; G          G --&gt;|No| H[Auto-fix where possible]         H --&gt; I{Fixable?}         I --&gt;|Yes| B         I --&gt;|No| J[Block with guidance]          G --&gt;|Yes| K{Phase 2: Agent Review}          subgraph Phase2[\"Phase 2: Context-Aware Agents\"]             K --&gt; L[Domain Alignment Agent]             K --&gt; M[Test Quality Agent]             K --&gt; N[Architecture Agent]             K --&gt; O[Documentation Agent]             K --&gt; P[Naming Coherence Agent]         end          L --&gt; Q[Aggregate Findings]         M --&gt; Q         N --&gt; Q         O --&gt; Q         P --&gt; Q          Q --&gt; R{Critical Issues?}         R --&gt;|Yes| S{Auto-correctable?}         S --&gt;|Yes| T[Apply Agent Corrections]         T --&gt; U{Re-review?}         U --&gt;|Yes| K         U --&gt;|No, max iterations| V[Present findings for decision]         S --&gt;|No| V          R --&gt;|No| W{Warnings?}         W --&gt;|Yes| X[Attach warnings to review]         W --&gt;|No| Y[Review Complete]         X --&gt; Y          V --&gt; Z{Override?}         Z --&gt;|Yes, with justification| X         Z --&gt;|No| AA[Address issues]         AA --&gt; A     end      Y --&gt; AB[Ready for Human Review]     AB --&gt; AC{Human Review}     AC --&gt;|Approved| AD[Merge]     AC --&gt;|Changes Requested| A"},{"location":"agentic-code-review/#phase-1-deterministic-checks","title":"Phase 1: Deterministic Checks","text":"<p>These run first because they're fast, cheap, and have no false positives when configured correctly.
