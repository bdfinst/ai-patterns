Formatting, linting, static analysis, security scanning;these have deterministic right answers and shouldn't consume human attention. If your team is still catching formatting issues in review, fix your tooling.</p> <p>Similarly, business logic correctness should be validated by tests, not by reading code. If a reviewer has to trace through implementation to determine whether it handles edge cases correctly, that's a missing test, not a review task.</p> <p>This becomes automatable when business rules are documented as test scenarios before coding begins. Agents can then verify that tests exist for each documented scenario and that the tests actually assert the expected outcomes. Review shifts from implementation to requirements. Errors that slip through are requirement errors;scenarios that were never documented;not implementation bugs that a test review would have caught.</p> <p>Even with proper tooling and test coverage, significant review time remains. Reviewers still evaluate naming coherence, domain alignment, architectural fit, documentation accuracy, and test quality;things that require understanding context and intent, not just pattern matching.</p> <p>This was manageable when code generation was the bottleneck. A developer might produce a few hundred lines of reviewable code per day. Review capacity roughly matched generation capacity.</p> <p>AI-assisted code generation has broken this balance. Developers using AI tools can generate code faster than teams can review it. Pull requests queue up. Reviewers batch work to stay efficient, which increases cycle time. The feedback loop that makes code review valuable, the fast iteration on design and approach, degrades.</p> <p>The result is a choice between thoroughness and speed. Teams either maintain review quality and accept slower delivery, or they reduce review depth to keep up. Neither option is good.</p> <p>The solution is to automate everything about code review that can be automated, reserving human attention for decisions that genuinely require human judgment.</p>"},{"location":"agentic-code-review/#goal-automate-everything-automatable","title":"Goal: Automate Everything Automatable","text":"<p>The goal is to reduce human review to only those decisions that genuinely require human judgment; design tradeoffs, architectural direction, business logic validation.

The trigger doesn't matter. What matters is that by the time a human reviewer sees the code, the automatable concerns have already been handled.

I make it my job to ensure that context is available. On a human team, I'll create a flow diagram of the business process, walk through the user's problem, share why this feature matters. A team that has the right business and technical information asks the right questions and makes the right decisions without anyone standing over them.</p> <p>I use the same mindset with agents. Start with three to five sentences describing the feature and its goals. Not how to build it. What it should accomplish and why. Then tell the agent: \"Here's what we're building. Plan the approach and ask me any clarifying questions.\" Let it generate a plan. Give feedback. Iterate until the plan makes sense. This takes maybe ten minutes and saves hours of rework.</p> <p>This is where most people fail. They skip the mission briefing and jump straight to \"write me a function that does X.\" The agent needs a broad enough understanding of the feature's goals to make architectural decisions. If you scope the task to a single function, it has no context for where that function fits, how it relates to the rest of the system, or how the pieces should be organized. It will produce something that works in isolation and creates a mess in context.</p> <p>When the agent understands the full scope of what you're trying to accomplish, it architects the solution. It decomposes the problem sensibly, puts boundaries in the right places, and designs components that interact cleanly. The AI is trained on good patterns. You don't have to remember them all and feed them in. You just have to give it enough context to apply them.</p>"},{"location":"ai-development-playbook/#define-done-before-you-start","title":"Define \"Done\" Before You Start","text":"<p>For each item in the plan, generate Gherkin feature files with test scenarios. Review them carefully. The AI will sometimes generate scenarios that are good ideas in general but wrong for your specific context. I've had it produce intense security test scenarios for a desktop tool I was building for myself. That's over-engineering. Cut what doesn't belong.</p> <p>This is acceptance-test-driven development, not classic TDD. The distinction matters when you're working with agents. Classic TDD operates at the unit level: write a failing test for a small piece of logic, make it pass, refactor. That's a powerful discipline for a human developer building up a solution incrementally with fast feedback on every decision. But when you hand that workflow to an agent, you're micromanaging at the wrong level. You're telling it to think one function at a time, which means it never sees the bigger picture and can't make architectural decisions.</p> <p>ATDD works at the scenario level. You define a behavior the system should exhibit from the user's perspective, write a failing acceptance test for that scenario, make it pass, then refactor. One scenario at a time. The failing test proves you're testing something real. Making it pass proves the code works. Refactoring keeps the codebase clean before you move to the next scenario. The agent has enough scope to decide how to structure the code, which components to create, and how they should interact, because it's solving for a meaningful outcome instead of an isolated unit. Unit tests still get written along the way, but the agent generates them as part of making the scenario pass, not as the primary driver.</p> <p>On a good team, nobody starts coding until everyone agrees on what success looks like. Same principle applies here.</p>"},{"location":"ai-development-playbook/#build-focused-specialists-with-an-orchestrator","title":"Build Focused Specialists with an Orchestrator","text":"<p>On a good human team, you have generalists with overlapping, complementary specialist skills. Everyone contributes broadly, but each person also brings depth in specific areas. With agents, you take that principle and sharpen it: create focused specialist agents for specific quality checks. A narrow focus with an optimized context window produces more accurate results. When you stuff an agent's context with everything in the repository and ask it to \"check quality,\" you get vague, generic feedback. It's the same thing that happens when you tell a human team member to \"just make it good.\" When you give an agent a specific job and only the information relevant to that job, it catches things a human reviewer would miss. This is the same principle behind Unix pipelines: small, sharp tools composed together beat one monolithic tool every time.</p> <p>An orchestrating agent with the overall feature context coordinates the work, the same way a team lead who understands the full picture makes sure the specialists are pulling in the same direction.</p> <p>Set up focused agents for the different aspects of quality:</p> <ul> <li>A test review agent that validates tests are well-written and declarative</li> <li>An architecture agent that checks for clean, modular structure</li> <li>A domain agent that validates proper design patterns</li> <li>A naming agent that ensures names are meaningful throughout the application</li> </ul> <p>\"Why do names matter if AI generates the code?\" Because names provide context for every agent that touches the code going forward. Meaningless names mean agents misuse things, regenerate things unnecessarily, and lose track of what's what. Names are more important now than they were before, not less.

Brittle tests that break when implementation changes are worse than no tests. So, have a test review agent review the tests for implementation coupling and edge case completeness.</p> <p>Don't tell the agent how to write the code. Tell it what the code should do. You wouldn't dictate every keystroke to a teammate. You'd share the context, define the acceptance criteria, and trust them to deliver, then review the work together.

That sounds radical, but think about what happens when I do. If I manually review every line, I become the constraint. Everything waits on me. That means batching up more work before each review, which means larger deliveries, which means more risk that we're building the wrong thing even if we're building it the right way. Manual code review recreates the same bottleneck that manual QA gates create: it feels like quality, but it slows feedback and increases batch size.
